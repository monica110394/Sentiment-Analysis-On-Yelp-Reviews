Usually, text databases are huge, so we need to feed these text into a GPU using batches, batch size 32 means that we will feed 32 texts at once to update parameters of our deep learning model. On running out of memory because of smaller GPU RAM, you can reduce batch size to 16. Here we have used Google Colab to execute our model hence bs=32. Also, training with large mini batches such as 128 or 256 might be bad.<br><br>\n","Reference -> https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-using-the-fastai-library-d686b238213e<br>\n","<br>\n","It is recommended to use smaller batch sizes if the GPU is not that large. Also, using larger batch sizes leads to lower train loss, but the test loss is comparatively larger. The test loss decreases if we decrease the batch size which is exactly what we want.<br> \n","Research Paper -> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ww_KRJ245Kaf","colab_type":"code","outputId":"5827b0ef-24ba-427f-d2c8-21f9f489b7c7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1572243710609,"user_tz":-660,"elapsed":150933,"user":{"displayName":"MONICA","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCxusdQuYfTLPLZAykvmc8_KKa5lsZzWbcsqwaq=s64","userId":"12889039987784681954"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":323}},"source":["# printing the sample of the batch\n","data_clas.show_batch()"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>target</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>xxbos i am not a xxunk reviewer , in fact , i rarely do so . xxmaj however , the xxup second of two bad experiences really motivated me to do so due to the sheer arrogance of nonetheless - the owner ! xxmaj yes - the owner ! ! \\r \\n \\r \\n  xxmaj first xxmaj negative xxmaj experience : xxmaj went on a xxmaj sunday with my</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>xxbos xxmaj hey there ! xxmaj from the looks of things you 're in the mood for some cooked animal . i know how you feel . xxmaj it was n't all that long ago when the same feeling came over me . xxmaj my primitive brain and its desire to xxunk on some protein that once had eyes was calling . i needed to stuff my gullet with as</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>xxbos xxmaj sometimes , i like to slip out in the middle of the night and go to this little dive bar full of pizzazz called , \" xxmaj the xxmaj city of xxmaj las xxmaj vegas . \" xxmaj it 's the type of bar where the wounded can go and feel safe . \\r \\n \\r \\n  xxmaj the bar is in a relatively run down area</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>xxbos xxmaj we will xxup never return . xxmaj this was a xxup terrible , xxup awful experience from beginning to end ... service , food , everything has taken me from a patron who took out - of - towners here , to someone who will xxup never return to this location . xxmaj biggest offense - serving beef in the veggie tacos and burros - more than once</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <td>xxbos xxmaj if you 're ever involved in an accident in xxmaj las xxmaj vegas and the xxmaj nevada xxmaj highway xxmaj patrol calls for a tow truck there 's a good chance you 're going to get familiar with xxmaj custom xxmaj towing . xxmaj you 're not going to be happy with the experience because it 's going to cost you money you were not expecting to get</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jWM4vpAUL7PN","colab_type":"text"},"source":["xx___ tags represent the aspects of language in a way that the computer can understand. <br><br>\n","__xxbos:__ marks the beginning of a sentence. <br>\n","__xxmaj:__ used to imply that the first letter of the next word is capitalized.<br>\n","__xxfld:__ represent separate parts of a document like title, summary etc., each one will get a separate field and so they will get numbered (e.g. xxfld 1, xxfld 2).<br>\n","__xup:__ if there's something in all caps, it gets lower cased and a token called xxup will get added to it.

I called ahead and planned something out with the manager, who was pretty helpful. But it did still mean I was paying a ridiculous amount of $$ for lettuce and a couple of strawberries. And for the most part they are terrible when dealing with people with dietary considerations:\\r\\n1. I ordered a salad and asked for no meat or cheese. You'd think they would put more of the other ingredients in it to compensate, but no - so I was essentially eating just lettuce with a very very sparse sprinkling of nuts. ALSO they served it WITH THE MEAT! and then clearly just took off the meat and gave it back to me instead of making a new one. EW. The manager apologized and said it wouldn't be charged - very nice. However, this didn't get communicated to the server who DID charge me for it!\\r\\n2. Their \"vegetarian green beans\" are made with beef broth! When I told the person that that wasn't \"vegetarian\" she argued it was \"just the broth\".

I've had to eat here a couple of times because of work events. This of course makes the scantily clad girls super awkward...\\r\\nIf you're vegan there is not much you can eat. You're looking at an overpriced salad that you've negotiated with the server to make sure you're getting food at all. I called ahead and planned something out with the manager, who was pretty helpful. But it did still mean I was paying a ridiculous amount of $$ for lettuce and a couple of strawberries. And for the most part they are terrible when dealing with people with dietary considerations:\\r\\n1. I ordered a salad and asked for no meat or cheese. You'd think they would put more of the other ingredients in it to compensate, but no - so I was essentially eating just lettuce with a very very sparse sprinkling of nuts. ALSO they served it WITH THE MEAT! and then clearly just took off the meat and gave it back to me instead of making a new one. EW. The manager apologized and said it wouldn't be charged - very nice. However, this didn't get communicated to the server who DID charge me for it!\\r\\n2. Their \"vegetarian green beans\" are made with beef broth! When I told the person that that wasn't \"vegetarian\" she argued it was \"just the broth\". I totally don't trust them at ALL to know what's in their food or to care if someone can't eat something.\n","3  test_4  The people here are so nice! I ordered on eat 24 and they promptly called me to double check that everything was correct it was really sweet!
